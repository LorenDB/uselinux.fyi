There are thousands of apps readily available for Linux. You can browse some of the available apps on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en); just keep in mind that there are even more apps for Linux than what is shown on Flathub.

However, you may wish to run a Windows-only app. No problem! Linux can run a large number of Windows apps using the [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) compatibility layer. To check if your Windows app is known to run on Wine, you can search Wine's [application database](https://appdb.winehq.org/).

If your app is not supported by Wine, take a look at CodeWeavers' [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/). It's a paid version of Wine with many enhancements.

For gamers, your games probably already run on Linux! Valve has worked with CodeWeavers to build the Proton compatibility layer, which lets most popular games on Steam run on Linux without problems.
