Do you value your digital privacy? Do you want your computer to remain truly yours? Are you tired of being told that you need to buy a new computer to use the latest version of Windows? Then you need to start using Linux.

## What is Linux?

Linux, like Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS, is an operating system (or OS), the software at the core of your computer. However, unlike its competitors, Linux is truly perfect for everyone. Unlike Windows and ChromeOS, it won't constantly track you, keeping you secure. Unlike macOS, it can be used on nearly any computer you can think of. And perhaps most importantly, it's open source, meaning the code is open for anybody to see. This helps make Linux the most secure operating system you've ever used.

## Should I switch to Linux?

Good question! It depends on what you use your computer for; not every app has a Linux version, so you might need to keep using your current operating system. However, Linux is perfectly capable of most tasks; whether you're an artist, a gamer, a CEO, or just somebody who wants to read email and surf the web, Linux has you covered.

## How do I get Linux?

We've compiled a guide to help you pick the version of Linux that will be perfect for you and then try it out on your computer! While trying Linux can look intimidating, this website's goal is to eliminate the intimidation and make Linux the best experience it can be.
