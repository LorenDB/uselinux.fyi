title = 'Linux for Apple Silicon'
+++

The [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org) project has made it possible to run Linux on many Macs with Apple Silicon. [Check to see if your Mac is supported](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/#device-support) before installing.

## Our recommendation

[Fedora Asahi Remix](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/) is currently the best option for Apple Silicon devices. In fact, it's the recommended distro of the Asahi Linux project. You can install it by opening the Terminal app on your Mac, typing `curl https://alx.sh | sh`, and pressing Enter.

### Others

[Ubuntu Asahi](https://ubuntuasahi.org) uses the same Asahi Linux base to bring the popular Ubuntu distro to your Apple Silicon Mac. Ubuntu's popularity and extensive library of third-party software makes it a great alternative choice to Fedora Asahi Remix. You can install it by opening the Terminal app on your Mac, typing `curl -sL https://ubuntuasahi.org/install | sh`, and pressing Enter.
