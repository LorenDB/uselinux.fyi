## Our recommendation

[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) is the perfect distro for a gamer. It comes with Steam preinstalled and supports thousands of games from many game stores. With support for laptops, desktops, and handheld game consoles, you can trust Bazzite to carry you to victory. Plus, you don't have to worry about installing GPU drivers - Bazzite comes with drivers for Nvidia, AMD, and Intel Arc so you can start playing immediately.

### Others

[Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) is a rock-solid distribution from Linux computer manufacturer [System76](https://system76.com/). While it's not aimed directly at gaming, many people have reported that it works great for gaming. If you have an Nvidia GPU, you can even download Pop!_OS with preinstalled graphics drivers.

[Nobara Linux](https://nobaraproject.org/) is quite similar to Bazzite, down to its roots in [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org), but it's run by only one person and is slightly less polished than Bazzite. With that being said, in the unlikely event that Bazzite doesn't work out for you, Nobara is a great second choice.
